# Product Requirement Document (PRD) - tinyAgent

## 1. Introduction

**tinyAgent** is a streamlined framework designed for building powerful LLM-powered agents. These agents are capable of solving complex tasks through effective tool execution, orchestration, and the dynamic creation of new capabilities.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

- **Primary Goal:** Simplify the process of building and managing AI-driven agents that perform tasks and interact with tools.
- **Key Objectives:**
  - Provide modular and reusable components (agents and tools).
  - Offer flexible methods for agent creation (`Orchestrator`, `AgentFactory`, `DynamicAgentFactory`).
  - Ensure robust error handling and logging.
  - Maintain a clean and understandable code structure.
  - Enable versatile interaction patterns for task execution.

## 3. Problem Statement

Developing and managing sophisticated AI agents that can interact with various tools and coordinate complex workflows can be challenging. tinyAgent aims to address this by providing a structured yet flexible framework.

## 4. Core Philosophy

The framework is built upon three core philosophical pillars:

1.  **Functions as Agents:** Encapsulating specific functionalities within dedicated agent structures.
2.  **Hierarchical Orchestra of Specialized Agents:** Organizing agents in a hierarchy where higher-level agents can coordinate specialized lower-level agents.
3.  **Dynamic Capability Creation:** Enabling the system to create new agent capabilities on the fly as needed.

## 5. Scope

- **In Scope:** Agent creation, tool registration and execution, basic orchestration, context management (initial), error handling, logging, configuration management.
- **Out of Scope (Initially):** Advanced multi-agent collaboration patterns, complex memory persistence beyond basic context, GUI, tool marketplace (Refer to Roadmap in `tasks/tasks_plan.md`).

## 6. Benefits

- **Modular Design:** Tools defined with `@tool` are easily integrated or swapped.
- **Flexible Agent Options:** Different factories cater to simple tasks, fine-tuned control, or dynamic creation.
- **Centralized Setup:** Factory pattern streamlines configuration and logging.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Custom exceptions improve debugging.
- **Clean Code Structure:** Clear separation of concerns between agent logic and tool execution.
- **Versatile Interaction:** Supports precise tool execution (`agent.execute_tool()`) and broader task execution (`agent.run()`).

## 7. Target Audience

Developers building applications requiring LLM agents to perform automated tasks, interact with external APIs/tools, or manage complex workflows.
