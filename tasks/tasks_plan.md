# tinyAgent Task Plan & Backlog

## Project Status

- **Current Phase:** Initialization & Foundational Setup (Based on initial README)
- **Core Functionality:** Basic agent creation (`Orchestrator`, `AgentFactory`, `DynamicAgentFactory`), tool registration (`@tool`), and execution framework exists conceptually.
- **Working Features (Needs Verification):** Core agent classes, tool decorator.
- **Known Issues:** Project is in **EARLY BETA**. Bugs and incomplete features are expected.

## Roadmap / Task Backlog (Based on initial README)

_(Status: P=Planned, IP=In Progress, D=Done)_

### Near-term (0-3 months)

- [D] **Configurable Security**: Implement enhanced security options for code execution (Marked as recently implemented in README).
- [P] **Memory and Context Management**: Improve handling of conversation history and context persistence.
- [P] **Multi-modal Support**: Add capabilities for handling images, audio, and other non-text inputs.
- [P] **Tool Chaining Improvements**: Enhance the robustness and flexibility of sequential tool executions.

### Mid-term (3-6 months)

- [P] **Advanced Orchestration Patterns**: Develop more sophisticated methods for task routing and agent collaboration.
- [P] **Expanded Model Provider Support**: Integrate with additional LLM providers and models beyond the initial setup (e.g., OpenRouter).
- [P] **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching, parallelization, or other techniques to improve speed and efficiency.
- [P] **Test Framework**: Build a comprehensive test suite to validate agent behavior and tool integration.

### Long-term (6+ months)

- [P] **Web Interface/Dashboard**: Create a graphical user interface for monitoring and managing agents.
- [P] **Tool Marketplace**: Develop an ecosystem for community-contributed tools.
- [P] **Multi-agent Collaboration**: Enhance capabilities for collaboration between multiple specialized agents.
- [P] **Learning and Adaptation**: Implement mechanisms for agents to learn and improve their performance over time based on usage patterns.

## Specific Immediate Tasks

- [D] **Initialize Project Documentation:** Create core memory files (`product_requirement_docs.md`, `architecture.md`, `technical.md`, `tasks_plan.md`, `active_context.md`).
- [P] **Verify Codebase:** Review the actual code to confirm the implementation details mentioned in the README (e.g., `ToolError`, `uv` usage, agent class structure).
- [P] **Setup Environment:** Ensure `.env` and `config.yml` are correctly configured for basic operation.
- [P] **Run Basic Example:** Execute a simple agent task to verify the core framework functionality.

_(Note: This plan is derived from the README roadmap and initial setup needs. It will be updated as development progresses and tasks are refined.)_
