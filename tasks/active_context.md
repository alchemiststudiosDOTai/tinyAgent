# Active Context - tinyAgent

**Date:** $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

## Current Focus

- **Project Initialization:** Setting up the initial project structure and documentation based on the provided `README.md` and the `memory.mdc` rule.

## Current State

- Core documentation directories (`docs/`, `tasks/`) created.
- Core Memory Files initialized with content derived from `README.md`:
  - `docs/product_requirement_docs.md`
  - `docs/architecture.md`
  - `docs/technical.md`
  - `tasks/tasks_plan.md` (includes initial roadmap and immediate tasks)
  - `tasks/active_context.md` (this file)
- The two rule files `error-documentation.mdc` and `lessons-learned.mdc` already exist in `.cursor/rules/` and are linked conceptually by the `memory.mdc` rule.

## Recent Changes

- Created the initial set of core memory files as listed above.

## Immediate Next Steps (from `tasks/tasks_plan.md`)

1.  **Verify Codebase:** Review the actual source code to confirm implementation details match the `README.md` and documentation.
2.  **Setup Environment:** Ensure `.env` and `config.yml` are correctly configured.
3.  **Run Basic Example:** Test the core framework functionality with a simple agent task.

## Active Decisions/Considerations

- The documentation is currently based solely on the `README.md`. It needs verification against the actual codebase.
- The distinction between `pip` and `uv` for dependency management needs clarification by checking `INSTALL.md` or the codebase.
- The existence and usage of specific components like `ToolError` need confirmation.
