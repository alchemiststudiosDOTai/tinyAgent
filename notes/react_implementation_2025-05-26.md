# Reasoning Agent Pattern Implementation Session
**Date:** May 26, 2025  
**Branch:** `codex/implement-reasoning_agent-(reasoning-+-acting)-pattern-for-json-input`

## Overview
This session focused on implementing the Reasoning Agent (Reasoning + Acting) pattern for the tinyAgent framework. Reasoning Agent is a prompting paradigm that makes agents more interpretable by having them explicitly reason through their actions in a thought → action → observation loop.

## Why Reasoning Agent?

### Current Agent Limitations
- The standard tinyAgent uses a black-box approach where the LLM directly selects tools
- Difficult to debug when things go wrong
- No visibility into the agent's reasoning process
- Hard to understand why certain decisions were made

### Reasoning Agent Benefits
1. **Transparency**: Each step shows the agent's thought process
2. **Debuggability**: Can see exactly where reasoning went wrong
3. **Iterative**: Agent can observe results and adjust approach
4. **Educational**: Makes it clear how AI agents work internally

## What We Implemented

### 1. Core Reasoning Agent Agent (`src/tinyagent/reasoning_agent/reasoning_agent_agent.py`)
- Created a minimal Reasoning Agent implementation with:
  - `ThoughtStep`: Records agent's reasoning
  - `ActionStep`: Records tool calls with arguments
  - `ObservationStep`: Records tool execution results
  - `Scratchpad`: Maintains conversation history
- The agent follows a loop: Think → Act → Observe → Repeat

### 2. Integration with TinyAgent Infrastructure
- Leveraged existing `get_llm()` function from tinyagent
- Used the robust JSON parser (`robust_json_parse`) to handle various LLM response formats
- Integrated with the `@tool` decorator pattern for consistency

### 3. Example Implementation (`examples/reasoning_agent_phase2.py`)
Key features:
- Visual step-by-step execution display
- Emoji indicators for different phases (💭 Thought, 🔧 Action, 👁️ Observation)
- Clear scratchpad display showing reasoning history
- Graceful handling of JSON parsing with multiple strategies

## Technical Details

### JSON Response Structure
```json
{
  "thought": "I need to add these numbers",
  "action": {
    "tool": "add_numbers",
    "args": {"a": 15, "b": 27}
  }
}
```

### Final Answer Format
```json
{
  "thought": "I have the result",
  "action": {
    "tool": "final_answer",
    "args": {"answer": "The answer is 42"}
  }
}
```

## Key Learnings

1. **LLM Prompting**: Need to explicitly specify available tools in the prompt
2. **JSON Parsing**: LLMs often wrap JSON in markdown code blocks; robust parsing is essential
3. **Tool Naming**: Must ensure LLM knows exact tool names to avoid "Unknown tool" errors
4. **Step Visualization**: Clear output formatting greatly improves debugging

## Example Output
```
STEP 1 - LLM CALL
📌 USER QUERY: What is 15 plus 27?
✅ PARSED JSON:
  💭 Thought: I need to add 15 and 27 to get the answer.
  🔧 Action: add_numbers
  📋 Args: {'a': 15, 'b': 27}

[Tool Execution] add_numbers(15, 27) = 42

STEP 2 - LLM CALL
📝 SCRATCHPAD:
  💭 Thought: I need to add 15 and 27 to get the answer.
  🔧 Action: {"tool": "add_numbers", "args": {"a": 15, "b": 27}}
  👁️ Observation: 42
🎯 FINAL ANSWER: 15 plus 27 is 42.
```

## Next Steps
1. Integrate Reasoning Agent pattern as an option in the main Agent class
2. Add more complex multi-step examples
3. Create Reasoning Agent-specific prompts for different types of tasks
4. Add configuration options for Reasoning Agent behavior (max steps, verbosity, etc.)
5. Benchmark Reasoning Agent vs standard agent performance

## Files Modified/Created
- `src/tinyagent/reasoning_agent/` - New module for Reasoning Agent implementation
- `src/tinyagent/reasoning_agent/reasoning_agent_agent.py` - Core Reasoning Agent agent
- `src/tinyagent/tools/g_login.py` - Example tool for testing
- `tests/08_reasoning_agent_agent_test.py` - Basic test case
- `examples/reasoning_agent_simple.py` - Phase 1 simple example
- `examples/reasoning_agent_phase2.py` - Phase 2 with real LLM integration

## Conclusion
The Reasoning Agent implementation provides a more transparent and debuggable approach to agent-based task execution. While the standard agent is more efficient for simple tasks, Reasoning Agent excels when visibility into the reasoning process is important, making it ideal for debugging, education, and complex multi-step tasks.
