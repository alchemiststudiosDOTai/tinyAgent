# Reasoning Agent Rename Session
**Date:** January 26, 2025
**Branch:** `codex/implement-react-pattern`

## Overview
This session focused on renaming the "ReAct" pattern implementation to "reasoning_agent" to avoid naming conflicts with React.js Python bindings.

## Problem
- The name "react" is problematic in Python as it conflicts with:
  - PyReact (Python bindings for React.js)
  - react-python packages
  - Common import patterns expecting React.js-related functionality
- Python naming conventions prefer descriptive lowercase names with underscores over acronym-style names

## What We Changed

### 1. Directory Structure
- Renamed: `src/tinyagent/react/` → `src/tinyagent/reasoning_agent/`
- Renamed: `react_agent.py` → `reasoning_agent.py`

### 2. Class and Method Names
- Class: `ReActAgent` → `ReasoningAgent`
- Method: `run_react()` → `run_reasoning()`
- Prompt text: "You are a ReAct agent" → "You are a reasoning agent"

### 3. Import Updates
- All imports changed from `from tinyagent.react` to `from tinyagent.reasoning_agent`
- Updated in:
  - `tests/08_react_agent_test.py`
  - `tests/09_react_scratchpad_test.py`
  - `examples/react_phase2.py`
  - `README.md`

### 4. Documentation Updates
- README.md: "ReAct Pattern" → "Reasoning Agent Pattern"
- Test docstrings: "ReAct agent" → "Reasoning agent"
- Example comments updated to reflect new naming

## Implementation Details

### Tools Used
1. **grep/ripgrep**: Found all occurrences of "react" in the codebase
2. **mv command**: Renamed directories and files
3. **MultiEdit tool**: Batch updated multiple occurrences in files
4. **pytest**: Verified all tests still pass after renaming

### Key Commands
```bash
# Search for all react occurrences
rg -i "react" --type py --type md

# Rename directory
mv src/tinyagent/react src/tinyagent/reasoning_agent

# Rename file
mv src/tinyagent/reasoning_agent/react_agent.py src/tinyagent/reasoning_agent/reasoning_agent.py

# Run tests
python3 -m pytest tests/08_react_agent_test.py tests/09_react_scratchpad_test.py -v
```

## Interesting Tidbits

1. **Sed Issues**: Initial attempt to use sed for bulk replacement caused some text duplication in the markdown notes files, showing the importance of using more precise tools like MultiEdit.

2. **Method Consistency**: Initially missed renaming `run_react()` to `run_reasoning()`, highlighting the importance of thorough searches beyond just class names.

3. **Test Success**: All 5 tests passed immediately after renaming, demonstrating good test isolation and proper use of dependency injection.

4. **Framework Design**: The renaming was relatively straightforward because the code was well-structured with clear separation of concerns.

## Final State
- ✅ No remaining "react" references in Python code
- ✅ All tests passing (5/5)
- ✅ Consistent naming throughout: `reasoning_agent`, `ReasoningAgent`, `run_reasoning()`
- ✅ Follows Python naming conventions (lowercase with underscores for modules)

## Lessons Learned
1. Naming matters - avoid names that conflict with popular packages
2. Python prefers descriptive names over acronyms
3. Comprehensive search and replace requires multiple strategies (grep, sed, manual edits)
4. Always run tests after major refactoring to ensure nothing broke

This rename improves the codebase by avoiding potential import conflicts and making the purpose of the module clearer (it's about reasoning, not React.js).
