# tinyAgent ü§ñ

A streamlined framework for building powerful LLM-powered agents that can solve complex tasks through tool execution, orchestration, and dynamic capability creation.

**Made by (x) @tunahorse21 | A product of alchemiststudios.ai**

> **IMPORTANT**: tinyAgent is in EARLY BETA until V1. Use common sense when working with this tool.  
> NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY ISSUES that may arise from its use.
> I made this becuase I wanted to, I work fulltime + business, bugs will be fixed asap but expect some issues until V1
> Nerds, please don't get mad, instead show me how "cracked" you are and open an issue with a fix !

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alchemiststudiosDOTai/tinyAgent.git

cd tinyagent

# Option 1: For Linux users, run the installation script
chmod +x install/linuxInstall.sh && ./install/linuxInstall.sh

# Option 2: Manual installation
# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
# Option 1: Using UV (recommended - see INSTALL.md for details)
# Option 2: Using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up required configuration files
# 1. Environment variables
cp .envexample .env
# Edit .env to add your API keys (especially OpenRouter)

# 2. Configuration file
cp exampleconfig.yml config.yml
# Edit config.yml to customize your settings
```

## Philosophy

1. **Functions as Agents**
   - You can turn **any function** into a **tool** or **agent**.
   - This makes it easy to add new capabilities.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Agent
    participant LLM
    participant ToolFunction

    User->>Agent: Natural language query
    Agent->>Agent: Build system prompt with tool descriptions
    Agent->>LLM: Send prompt + query
    LLM-->>Agent: Response (plain answer or tool call JSON)
    alt Tool call indicated
        Agent->>ToolFunction: Execute function with extracted arguments
        ToolFunction-->>Agent: Function result
        Agent-->>User: Return function result
    else Plain answer
        Agent-->>User: Return plain answer
    end
```

2. **Hierarchical Orchestration**
   - You can **combine many agents** together.
   - A **top-level agent** or **orchestrator** can **delegate tasks** to **specialized agents**.
   - This helps solve **complex problems** by breaking them into parts.

```mermaid

    O["Research Orchestrator"] --> A1["Web Search Agent"]
    O --> A2["Summarizer Agent"]
    O --> A3["Code Snippet Agent"]
```

3. **Elder Brain (Experimental)**
   - You give it **one big prompt**.
   - It **analyzes** the task, **plans** steps, **runs tools/agents**, and **combines results**.
   - Acts like a **project manager** for complex workflows.
   - **Highly experimental** and still in development.

```mermaid

    U["Research AI trends and generate report"] --> EB["Elder Brain"]
    EB --> AN["Analyze task"]
    EB --> PL["Plan steps"]
    EB --> EX["Run tools & agents"]
    EX --> R["Final Report"]
```

## Features

1. **Modular Design**

   - Tools are defined with `@tool` and easily integrated or swapped.

2. **Flexible Agent Options**

   - **Orchestrator**: Simple task execution.
   - **AgentFactory**: Fine-tuned control.
   - **DynamicAgentFactory**: Dynamic agent creation.

3. **Centralized Setup**

   - Factory pattern streamlines configuration and logging.

4. **Robust Error Handling**

   - Custom exceptions (e.g., `ToolError`) improve debugging.

5. **Clean Code Structure**

   - Agents handle logic; tools handle execution.

6. **Versatile Interaction**

   - Use `agent.execute_tool()` for precision or `agent.run()` for broader tasks.

7. **Structured Output**
   - Enforce JSON structure on LLM responses for consistent parsing
   - Enable with `output.structured: true` in config.yml
   - Compatible with OpenRouter's JSON schema validation

## Contributing

## Contributions to tinyAgent are welcome! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation, your help is appreciated.

## Key Takeaways

- **tinyAgent** is perfect for scalable AI projects needing structured agent and tool management.
- It offers **extensibility**, **error handling**, and **logging**, but may be overkill for simple tasks.

_Important Note on Tools_:

The aider tool integrated in TinyAgent is extremely powerful but requires proper understanding to use effectively. It's highly configurable with many advanced features that can dramatically enhance productivity when used correctly.

**‚ö†Ô∏è We strongly recommend thoroughly learning aider before using it in any serious projects.**

Invest time in studying the documentation at https://aider.chat/ to understand its capabilities, configuration options, and best practices. This investment will pay off significantly in your development workflow.
