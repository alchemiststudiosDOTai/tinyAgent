### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alchemiststudiosDOTai/tinyAgent.git

cd tinyagent

# Option 1: For Linux users, run the installation script
chmod +x install/linuxInstall.sh && ./install/linuxInstall.sh

# Option 2: Manual installation
# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
# Option 1: Using UV (recommended - see INSTALL.md for details)
# Option 2: Using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up required configuration files
# 1. Environment variables
cp .envexample .env
# Edit .env to add your API keys (especially OpenRouter)

# 2. Configuration file
cp exampleconfig.yml config.yml
# Edit config.yml to customize your settings

## Philosophy
### 1. Functions as Agents
### 2. Hierarchical Orchestra of Specialized Agents
### 3. Dynamic Capability Creation

The **tinyAgent** framework is designed to simplify building and managing AI-driven agents that perform tasks and interact with tools. It provides three methods for creating agents‚Äî`Orchestrator`, `AgentFactory`, and `DynamicAgentFactory`‚Äîeach tailored to different needs, from simple workflows to complex, dynamic setups. Agents can register tools, manage workflows, and maintain context, with key features like:

- **High-level Orchestrator**: Easy task management.
- **AgentFactory**: Detailed control over agent setup and tools.
- **DynamicAgentFactory**: On-the-fly creation of specialized agents.
- **Tool Decorators**: Simple tool registration with `@tool`.
- **Structured Results**: Consistent tool output handling.
- **Error Handling and Logging**: Built-in for reliability.

## Installation

Here‚Äôs how to install and set up **tinyAgent**:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/tinyAgent.git
   cd tinyAgent
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Requires Python 3.8+.
   - Install packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Configure Settings**:
   - Copy the example config:
     ```bash
     cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
     ```
   - Update `config.yaml` with your model details, API keys, etc.

4. **Optional: Use a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

Check the [official docs](https://github.com/your-repo/tinyAgent/blob/main/docs/installation.md) for more details.

## Benefits

1. **Modular Design**  
   - Tools are defined with `@tool` and easily integrated or swapped.

2. **Flexible Agent Options**  
   - **Orchestrator**: Simple task execution.  
   - **AgentFactory**: Fine-tuned control.  
   - **DynamicAgentFactory**: Dynamic agent creation.

3. **Centralized Setup**  
   - Factory pattern streamlines configuration and logging.

4. **Robust Error Handling**  
   - Custom exceptions (e.g., `ToolError`) improve debugging.

5. **Clean Code Structure**  
   - Agents handle logic; tools handle execution.

6. **Versatile Interaction**  
   - Use `agent.execute_tool()` for precision or `agent.run()` for broader tasks.
