Heads Up

tinyAgent is in BETA until V1. Itâ€™s working but still evolving! I canâ€™t guarantee itâ€™s 100% bug-free, but Iâ€™m actively improving it whenever I can between my day job and business.
Found something that could be better? Show off your skills and open an issue with a fix: Iâ€™d genuinely appreciate it!

Overview

tinyAgent is a streamlined framework for building powerful, LLM powered agents that solve complex tasks through tool execution, orchestration, and dynamic capability creation. Convert any Python function into a useful tool and then into an agent with minimal configuration, which opens up a world of scalable, modular possibilities for your projects.

â¸»

Installation

Via pip (Recommended)

Install tinyAgent easily with a single command:

pip install tiny_agent_os

Cloning for Development

To clone the repository and contribute or experiment directly:

git clone https://github.com/alchemiststudiosDOTai/tinyAgent.git
cd tinyAgent

For Linux Users

Run the provided installation script:

chmod +x install/linuxInstall.sh && ./install/linuxInstall.sh

Manual Installation
	1.	Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

python3 -m venv .venv


	2.	Activate the Virtual Environment:
	â€¢	On macOS/Linux:

source .venv/bin/activate


	â€¢	On Windows:

.\.venv\Scripts\activate


	3.	Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	4.	Set Up Required Configuration Files:
Copy the example configuration files:

cp exampleconfig.yml config.yml
cp .envexample .env

Then, edit config.yml and .env to customize your settings and add your API keys (especially for OpenRouter).

Post-Installation Configuration for Pip Users

After installing via pip, you need to provide your own configuration files. For convenience, download them directly:

Download the Configuration File (config.yml)

Using wget:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alchemiststudiosDOTai/tinyAgent/v0.65/config.yml

Or using curl:

curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alchemiststudiosDOTai/tinyAgent/v0.65/config.yml

Download the Environment File (.env)

Download the example environment file (renaming it to .env is required):

Using wget:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alchemiststudiosDOTai/tinyAgent/v0.65/.envexample -O .env

Or using curl:

curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alchemiststudiosDOTai/tinyAgent/v0.65/.envexample

Note: Be sure to edit the .env file with your actual API keys and any other necessary variables.

Example Usage

The following example demonstrates the heart of tinyAgent: turning a simple function into a fully capable agent.

#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Example: Functions as Agents

This example shows how to convert a simple function into a tool with tinyAgent.
"""
from tinyagent.decorators import tool
from tinyagent.factory.agent_factory import AgentFactory

# Define a simple calculator function and turn it into a tool
@tool
def calculate_sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Calculate the sum of two integers."""
    return a + b

def main():
    """Create a basic agent with the calculator tool."""
    # Create an agent with our tool
    agent = AgentFactory.get_instance().create_agent(tools=[calculate_sum])
    query = "calculate the sum of 5 and 3"
    print(f"Running agent with query: '{query}'")
    result = agent.run(query, expected_type=int)  # Expect an integer result
    print(f"Result: {result}")
    print(f"Result Type: {type(result)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Tools and the @tool Decorator

tinyAgentâ€™s power comes from toolsâ€”Python functions that can be transformed into agent-accessible functionality. By simply decorating a function with @tool, you make it discoverable and usable by the agent.

Brief Overview of Creating a Tool
	1.	Import the tool Decorator

from tinyagent.decorators import tool


	2.	Define Your Function
	â€¢	Provide clear docstrings describing inputs, outputs, and function purpose.
	3.	Decorate Your Function

@tool
def my_function(arg1: str, arg2: int) -> bool:
    """Explain what this tool does, the expected input, and output."""
    # Implementation details here
    return True


	4.	Use in an Agent
	â€¢	Create or obtain an instance of your agent and pass in your newly decorated function as a tool. The agent can now discover and utilize it to accomplish tasks.

Example: Calculator Tool

Below is an example of turning a basic calculator function (like the calculate_sum function) into a tool using the @tool decorator:

from tinyagent.decorators import tool
from tinyagent.factory.agent_factory import AgentFactory

@tool
def calculate_sum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the sum of two integers.

    :param a: First integer
    :param b: Second integer
    :return: Sum of a and b
    """
    return a + b

def main():
    # Create an agent with our calculator tool
    agent = AgentFactory.get_instance().create_agent(tools=[calculate_sum])
    # The agent can now interpret instructions like "add X and Y"
    result = agent.run("What is the sum of 10 and 4?", expected_type=int)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Using the @tool decorator is all it takes to convert any Python function into a powerful building block for your agentâ€™s capabilities.

Philosophy

tinyAgent is built on two core ideas:

Functions as Agents

Any Python function can be transformed into a toolâ€”and then seamlessly integrated into an agent. This approach makes extending and innovating simple. Just tag your functions with the @tool decorator and let tinyAgent do the rest.

    C --> D["Result"]

Hierarchical Orchestration

For more complex tasks, tinyAgent allows multiple agents to work together. A master orchestrator can delegate work to specialized agentsâ€”such as web search, summarization, or code snippet agentsâ€”to solve problems step-by-step.

NOTE: This is still in early development

Features
	â€¢	Modular Design: Easily convert any function into a tool using the @tool decorator.
	â€¢	Flexible Agent Options: Leverage simple orchestrators, fine-tuned control with AgentFactory, or dynamic agent creation.
	â€¢	Centralized Setup: Configure the framework using environment variables and configuration files.
	â€¢	Robust Error Handling: Benefit from improved debugging with custom exceptions (e.g., ToolError).
	â€¢	Versatile Interaction: Choose precise tool execution via agent.execute_tool() or broader command execution with agent.run().
	â€¢	Structured Output: Optionally enforce JSON formatting for consistent, structured responses.
