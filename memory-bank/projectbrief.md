# Project Brief

## Core Purpose

Develop a lightweight Python framework for building and orchestrating AI agents with capabilities for tool usage, conversation management, and system integration.

## Key Requirements

1. Modular agent architecture with decorator-based tool registration
2. MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for extended capabilities
3. CLI interface for agent management
4. Comprehensive documentation and examples
5. Cross-platform compatibility
6. Memory bank system for agent context persistence

## Scope Boundaries

- Focus on core agent patterns rather than UI development
- Prioritize extensibility over built-in features
- Maintain minimal dependencies
- Support both local and remote agent operations

## Success Metrics

1. 10+ example implementations in cookbook
2. Full documentation of architecture patterns
3. CI/CD pipeline with test coverage
4. PyPI package distribution
