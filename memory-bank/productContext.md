# Product Context

## Why This Exists

Lightweight AI agent frameworks need:

- Standardized tool integration patterns
- Context persistence between sessions
- Clear separation between core and extended capabilities

## Problem Space

- Existing solutions are either too heavyweight or lack extensibility
- Agent memory management is often an afterthought
- MCP integration requires custom implementations

## Value Proposition

- 𝗠𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗲 with decorator-based extensibility
- Built-in memory bank system for context continuity
- Native MCP server/client implementation

## User Experience Goals

1. Developers can create new agents in <5 minutes
2. Clear documentation of architectural patterns
3. Zero-config MCP integration
4. Visual workflow documentation
